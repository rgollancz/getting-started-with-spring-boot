# Getting started with Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

Use these resources to get a quick introduction to key Spring Boot concepts, and learn how to quickly build a working Spring Boot application with the lab exercises. You can find the solutions to these in their respective branches.

This repo was originally created to support the Getting Started with Spring Boot workshop included in [Spring One 2021](https://springone.io/2021/workshops/instructorled/spring-boot).
